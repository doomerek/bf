## Getting Started
Although much of _BF_ uses PHP, this isn't mandatory. You can use just the HTML, CSS, and javascript components if you're developing a static HTML page.

Otherwise, if you plan to utilize PHP, you'll need to use a server. If developing on a local machine, a WAMP, LAMP, or MAMP server will need to be used (depending on what operating system you're using). 

If you plan to develop your project in a specific folder (directory), you'll need to specify the folder name (_$basedir_ variable) in the _core/bekah.php_ script (ex: 'sub-dir'). Otherwise, it's best to build in either a root domain or subdomain folder. 

### Structure
There are two primary folders: _/app_ and _/core_. The app directory is for files and folders that you plan to regularly modify, whereas the core directory is for the static (unchanging) files and folders. 

For your convenience, more detailed documentation and examples are provided in the root directory. These include both HTML and PHP pages.
